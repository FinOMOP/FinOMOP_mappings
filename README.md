OMOP vocabualies are downloaded from [Athena](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/start) and stored in [FinOMOP_vocabularies](https://github.com/FinOMOP/FinOMOP_vocabularies).
This repository, [FinOMOP_mappings](https://github.com/FinOMOP/FinOMOP_mappings), tracks the changes of mapping files in `usagi-extended` format for multiple vocabularies. 
Mapping files are transformed, appended to the OMOP vocabulary tables and stored in [FinOMOP_vocabularies](https://github.com/FinOMOP/FinOMOP_vocabularies), for the FinOMOP members to use in their ETLs.


The repository :
- Stores mapping files in `usagi-extended` format (USAGI v1.4.0 format plus few additional columns) for multiple vocabularies ([see](https://finomop.github.io/ROMOPMappingTools/articles/filesFormat.html)). 
- Stores code counts from different Finnish institutions for assessing mapping coverage. 
- Automatically validates changes in the mapping files and blocks its merge if the changes are not valid.
- Automatically updates the [Status Dashboard](https://finomop.github.io/FinOMOP_mappings/) when a new release is created.
- Automatically creates a new vocabulary release in [FinOMOP_vocabularies](https://github.com/FinOMOP/FinOMOP_vocabularies) when a new release is created.
- Allows to manually update mapping files based on a new Athena release.

(this repo uses the companion R package [ROMOPMappingTools](https://github.com/FinOMOP/ROMOPMappingTools))

# Quick reference

## For CDM users
You can see how well a vocabulary covers you data in the [Status Dashboard](https://finomop.github.io/FinOMOP_mappings/).
